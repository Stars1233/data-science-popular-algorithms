Programming Languages: Python

The MovieLens dataset consisting of 20M ratings and 466K tag applications across 27K movies spanning a period of 20 years, from January 1995 to March 2015, is used to constract simple Top N Movie Recommender that generates N recommendations for a user using Item based Nearest-Neighbor Collaborative Filtering. In case of Item-based CF, the system finds similar items and assuming that similar items will be rated in a similar way by the same person, it predicts the rating corresponding to a user assigned to that item. Usually, the Item-based CF is preferred over the User-based CF because users can change their preferences and choices (aging, change of environment) whereas items (relatively) does not change over time.

Files consists of the following parts:
- Introduction to recommender systems
- Description and Descriptive Statistics for MovieLens data
- MovieLens data visualization
- Methodology: description of Collaborative Filtering (CF) and KNN algorithmms
- Top-N Movie Recommender System Algorithm step-by-step
- Evaluation of the results
